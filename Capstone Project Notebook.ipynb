When you view the business term, you\u2019ll see the policy or rule listed twice on the Related Content page.\n\nRefresh your browser after adding the Watson Knowledge Catalog app\nIf you add the Watson Knowledge Catalog app to your account using the Try-Out link on the landing page, you must refresh your browser to see catalog items.\n\nAdd collaborators with lowercase email addresses\nWhen you add collaborators to the catalog, enter email addresses with all lowercase letters. Mixed-case email addresses are not supported.\n\nObject Storage connection restrictions\nWhen you look at an Cloud Object Storage (S3 API) or Cloudant connection, the folder itself is listed as a child asset.\n\nMultiple concurrent connection operations might fail\nAn error might be encountered when multiple users are running connection operations concurrently. The error message can vary.\n\nCan\u2019t enable policies after catalog creation\nYou cannot enable the enforcement of policies after you create a catalog. To apply policies to the assets in a catalog, you must enable enforcement during catalog creation.\n\nPolicies\nIf you use the Watson Knowledge Catalog app, you might encounter these known issues and restrictions when you use policies.\n\nData is not masked in some project tools\nWhen you add a connected data asset that has masked columns from a catalog to a project, the columns remain masked when you view the data and when you refine the data in the Data Refinery tool. Other tools in projects, however, do not preserve masking when accessing data through a connection. For example, when you load connected data in a notebook, you access the data through a direct connection and bypass masking.\n\nWorkaround To retain masking of connected data, create a new asset with Data Refinery:\n\nOpen the connected data asset and click Refine'''",
